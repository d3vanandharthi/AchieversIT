Ans> String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, Object, Function

2.) What kind of numbers are represented by the number type in JavaScript? 
Ans>Both int & Float

3.) What is the limitation of the number data type? 
Ans> The largest integer that can be safely represented in JavaScript is 2⁵³ — 1, or 9007199254740991

4.) What are the two possible values of the Boolean data type? 
Ans> true false

Ans>String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol.

7.) What is the difference between a primitive data type and an object data type in JavaScript? 
Ans> Primitive data types are simple and immutable values like numbers or strings, while object data types are complex, mutable structures like arrays or objects that store collections of data.

8.) What does the NULL data type represent in JavaScript? 
Object

9.) What is the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript? 
let: Variable that can be reassigned, and is block-scoped.
var: Variable that can be reassigned, and is function-scoped (or globally if outside a function).
const: Constant variable that cannot be reassigned, and is block-scoped.

10.) How to declare multiple Variables in JavaScript? |
let x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;

11.) Find the remainder of a division of two numbers using the modulus operator (%). 
Let num1=2,num3=4;
let remainder = num1 % num2

12.) Start with a counter variable and increment it by 1, then decrement it by 1.
Counter++, Counter  - -  

13.) Convert a number into string and string into number. 
let num = 42;
let numAsString = num.toString();  

let str = "123";
let strAsNumber = Number(str);


14.) Calculate and display the square of a number. 
let num = 5;
let square = num * num; 
console.log(square); 

15.) Given three numbers, calculate their average. 
let average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

16.) Given two strings, concatenate them with a space in between. 
let concatenatedString = str1 + " " + str2; 

17.) Convert a given number of minutes into seconds. 
let minutes = 5; let seconds = minutes * 60


18.) Given a string containing a number (e.g., "5"), convert it to a number, increment by 1, and convert back to a string. 

let str = "5";
let num = Number(str);  
num++;           
let result = num.toString(); 
console.log(result);

19.) Determine if a given number is even or odd. 
let num = 7; 
let result = (num % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd"
20.) Convert a non-empty string to a Boolean (true). 

let str = "Hello"; let booleanValue = Boolean(str)
